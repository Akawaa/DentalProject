                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Amalgam fillings are strong and can withstand the forces of chewing.</li>
                                        <li>They are relatively inexpensive, compared with alternatives.</li>
                                        <li>An amalgam filling can be completed in one dental visit.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Disadvantages : </strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Amalgam doesn't match the color of your teeth.</li>
                                        <li>Healthy parts of your tooth often must be removed to make a space large enough to hold an amalgam filling.</li>
                                        <li>Amalgam fillings can corrode or tarnish over time, causing discoloration where the filling meets the tooth.</li>
                                        <li>A traditional (non-bonded) amalgam filling does not bond (stick) to your tooth. The cavity preparation (the "pocket" in your tooth)
                                            developed by your dentist requires undercuts or ledges to provide retention of the filling. Your dentist may have to remove additional
                                            tooth structure to establish good retention for the filling.</li>
                                        <li>Some people may be allergic to mercury or be concerned about its effects, although research shows the amount of mercury exposure from
                                            fillings is similar to what people get from other sources in the environment.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Made Of : </strong>A mixture of plastic and fine glass particles.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Types : </strong>Direct and indirect. Direct fillings are placed by your dentist
                                        using a bright blue light that hardens the soft material. For indirect fillings, your dentist
                                        prepares the tooth, takes an impression and a laboratory makes the filling. During a second visit,
                                        your dentist cements this filling into place.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Used for : </strong>Small and large fillings, especially in front teeth or the visible parts of teeth; also for inlays.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Lasts : </strong>At least five years.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Costs : </strong> More than amalgam, but less than gold.</p>

                                        <li>A filling can be completed in one dental visit. An inlay may require two visits.</li>
                                        <li>Composite fillings can bond directly to the tooth, making the tooth stronger than it would be with an amalgam filling.</li>
                                        <li>Less drilling is involved than with amalgam fillings because your dentist does not have to shape the space as much to hold the
                                            filling securely. The bonding process holds the composite resin in the tooth.</li>
                                        <li>Indirect composite fillings and inlays are heat-cured, increasing their strength.</li>
                                        <li>Composite resin can be used in combination with other materials, such as glass ionomer, to provide the benefits of both materials.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Although composite resins have become stronger and more resistant to wear, it's not clear whether they are
                                            strong enough to last as long as amalgam fillings under the pressure of chewing</li>
                                        <li>The composite may shrink when placed; this can lead to more cavities in the future in areas where the filling is
                                            not making good contact with your tooth. The shrinkage is reduced when your dentist places this type of filling in thin layers.</li>
                                        <li>These fillings take more time to place because they are usually placed in layers. The increased time and labor involved also contribute
                                            to the higher cost (compared with amalgam fillings).</li>
                                        <li>Indirect fillings and inlays take at least two visits to complete. Your dentist takes impressions at the first visit and places the
                                            filling or inlay at the second visit.</li>
                                        <li>In large cavities, composites may not last as long as amalgam fillings.</li>

                                            makes an impression of your tooth and a temporary filling is placed. The gold filling is made from the
                                            impression and is placed at a second visit.</li>
                                        <li>The cost is high because of the high cost of gold and the work involved.</li>
                                        <li>If gold and amalgam fillings are right next to each other in your mouth, an electric current can result

                                        <li>It may be difficult to find a dentist who offers gold foil as an option because it is being replaced
                                            by other materials that match the color of your teeth.

                                        also is used for fillings in front teeth or to fill areas around the necks of your teeth or on roots.
                                        As filling material, glass ionomer is typically used in people with a lot of decay in the part of the
                                        tooth that extends below the gum (root caries). It is also used for filling baby teeth and as a liner
                                        for other types of fillings.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Glass ionomer matches the color of the teeth, although it does not always match as well as
                                            composite resin. Resin-modified glass ionomer is usually a better match than traditional glass
                                            ionomer.</li>
                                        <li>In some cases, no drilling is needed to place a glass ionomer filling. This makes this type of
                                            filling useful for small children.</li>
                                        <li>Glass ionomers release fluoride, which can help protect the tooth from further decay.</li>
                                        <li>Glass ionomer restorations bond (stick) to the tooth, which helps to prevent leakage around the
                                            filling and further decay.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Disadvantages : </strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Traditional glass ionomer is significantly weaker than composite resin. It is much more likely
                                            to wear or fracture.</li>
                                        <li>Traditional glass ionomer does not match your tooth color as precisely as composite resin.</li>
                                        <li>If you are getting a resin-modified glass ionomer filling, each thin layer needs to be cured,
                                            or hardened, with a special bright blue light before the next layer can be added. This makes
                                            the tooth stronger, but can lengthen the time of the dental appointment.</li>
